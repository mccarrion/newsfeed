## Settings for this project

This project only has two sets of settings at this current time. The local
settings are two Docker containers. One runs Django and another runs an image
of PostgreSQL that is maintained by the Docker company itself.

The production settings are set for uploading the website to a Heroku cloud
server and serving images from an AWS S3 server. Feel free to change either the
production or local settings at will.
