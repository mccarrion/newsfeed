Newsfeed Website
========================

This is a newsfeed website with a fully decoupled frontend and backend. The frontend which is stored in **frontend**
is a React app written in JavaScript. The backend which is stored in **newsfeed** is written in Python using the FastAPI
library.

## Current state of the App

On the side I am working on a full rewrite of the fullstack app. A decent number of features will be dropped as we are 
starting over from the beginning. Django is being replaced with FastAPI. Frontend will remain React but be developed in 
a more straightforward way.
